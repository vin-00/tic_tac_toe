# Description
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game, a classic tactical challenge where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of your chosen symbol (either "X" or "O"). Test your strategic thinking against a friend and see who can outmaneuver the opponent!

# How to Play
1. Choose a player to start (Player 1 is typically "X" and Player 2 is "O").
2. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty space on the grid.
3. The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination or the board is full (resulting in a tie).
4. Celebrate victory or gracefully accept defeat!
